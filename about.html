            <h2>The History of Brick-Breaking Games</h2>
            <div class="content-columns">
                <div class="column">
                    <h3>The Origins</h3>
                    <p>The brick-breaking game concept originated in 1976 with Atari's Breakout, designed by Nolan Bushnell and Steve Bristow. Interestingly, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak (who later founded Apple) worked on the prototype. The game featured a simple premise: use a paddle to bounce a ball and break a wall of bricks.</p>
                    <p>This simple yet addictive gameplay became an instant hit in arcades around the world, spawning numerous variations and adaptations over the decades.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="column">
                    <h3>Evolution of the Genre</h3>
                    <p>In the 1980s, games like Arkanoid expanded on the concept by adding power-ups, different brick types, and enemies. The 1990s saw the game transition to home computers and consoles, while the 2000s brought mobile versions that introduced touch controls.</p>
                    <p>Today, brick-breaking games continue to be popular due to their simple mechanics, strategic depth, and pick-up-and-play accessibility.</p>
